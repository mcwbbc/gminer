        <h4>gminer works best with a newer browser than you are using.</h4>
        <p>To get the best possible experience using gminer, we recommend that you upgrade your browser to a newer version.

The upgrade is free. If you’re using a PC at work you should contact your IT-administrator. Either way, we'd like to encourage you to stop using IE6 and try a more secure and Web Standards-friendly browser.</p>
